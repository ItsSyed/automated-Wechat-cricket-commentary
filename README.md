A python script that fetches live cricket commentary from a source(I've used ESPN Cricinfo), and sends it to a contact on Whatsapp automatically, at regular intervals.
Easily configurable as per one's own use-case, can change -
- Schedule interval (can be in seconds/minutes/hours/days, refer [Schedule Docs](https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)).
- Match URL - in [properties.py](properties.py)
![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) `(P.S.: ESPN Cricinfo only. Will have to dig into the HTML again for another site, so I'm fine with just this one!)`
- Display options.
