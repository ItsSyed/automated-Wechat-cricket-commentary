A python script that fetches live cricket commentary from a source(I've used ESPN Cricinfo, can change the URL), and sends it to a contact on Whatsapp.
Easily configurable as per one's own use-case, can change -
- Schedule interval (can be in seconds/minutes/hours/days, refer [https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](Schedule-Docs)).
- Match URL(ESPN Cricinfo only. Will have to dig into the HTML again for another site, so I'm fine with just this one!).
